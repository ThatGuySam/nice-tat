Good article formatting isn't just about aesthetics—it directly
impacts whether people **actually read** your content. The Nielsen
Norman Group has decades of research showing that most users scan
rather than read, and proper formatting can mean the difference
between engagement and abandonment.

## Why Readability Matters

Research shows that users spend an average of just 10-20 seconds
on a page before deciding whether to stay. Poor typography and
formatting create friction that drives readers away, even when
the content itself is valuable.

<Callout type="note">
  **79% of users scan** rather than read word-by-word.
  Format your content to support this natural behavior.
</Callout>

The three pillars of readable text are:

1. **Legibility** — Can readers physically see the text?
2. **Readability** — Can they smoothly read sentences?
3. **Scan-ability** — Can they navigate and find information?

## Typography Fundamentals

### Font Size

Use a **reasonably large default font size**. NNG recommends at
least 16px for body text, with 18px being more comfortable for
long-form reading. This template uses 18px as the base.

<Callout type="tip" title="Accessibility">
  Always let users change font size through browser settings.
  Never lock text sizes with `!important` or viewport units
  that prevent scaling.
</Callout>

### Font Choice

Use **clean, simple typefaces** for body text. Save decorative
or display fonts for headings and accents only. This template
uses:

- **Inter** for body text (clean sans-serif)
- **JetBrains Mono** for code blocks only

### Contrast

Maintain **high contrast** between text and background. Dark
text on light backgrounds (or vice versa) with a plain,
non-busy background.

## Line Length & Spacing

### Optimal Line Width

Keep lines between **50-75 characters** wide. Too-wide lines
make it difficult to track back to the next line. Too-narrow
lines disrupt reading flow.

This template uses `max-w-prose` which sets a `65ch` max-width—
right in the sweet spot.

<Callout type="warning">
  Full-width text on large screens is a common mistake.
  A 1920px-wide paragraph is nearly impossible to read
  comfortably.
</Callout>

### Line Height

Line height should increase with line length. The golden ratio
(1.618) provides a good starting point:

```
16px font × 1.625 = 26px line-height
18px font × 1.625 = 29px line-height
```

This template uses `leading-relaxed` (1.625 ratio) for
comfortable reading.

## Visual Hierarchy

Create a **"layer-cake" pattern** where headings and subheadings
stand out visually, allowing readers to scan the structure at
a glance.

### Heading Levels

Each heading level should be visually distinct:

- **H1**: Article title (only one per page)
- **H2**: Major sections
- **H3**: Subsections within H2s
- **H4**: Further breakdown if needed

Never skip heading levels (e.g., H1 → H3). This confuses both
readers and screen readers.

### Emphasis

Use **bold for keywords** and important phrases that help
scanners. Use *italics* for emphasis within sentences. But
use both **sparingly**—if everything is emphasized, nothing is.

## Formatting Long Content

For articles over 1,000 words, NNG recommends these structural
helpers:

### 1. Summary / Key Takeaways

Place a summary at the top so readers can quickly assess
relevance. This template provides the `<Summary>` component
for this purpose.

### 2. Table of Contents

Add navigation for longer pieces. The `<TableOfContents>`
component creates in-page links to each section.

### 3. Bullet Points

Break information into scannable lists:

- Easier to scan than paragraphs
- Each point stands alone
- White space aids comprehension

### 4. Callouts

Use the `<Callout>` component to highlight:

<Callout type="tip">
  Tips and helpful suggestions
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Warnings and cautions
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger">
  Critical information that could cause problems if ignored
</Callout>

### 5. Code Blocks

For technical content, use syntax-highlighted code blocks:

```javascript
// Example: calculating reading time
function calculateReadingTime(text) {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const wordCount = text.split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.ceil(wordCount / wordsPerMinute);
}
```

### 6. Images & Figures

Use helpful visuals to break up text and illustrate concepts.
Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility.

## Conclusion

Good formatting is invisible when done well—readers simply
enjoy the content without friction. By following these
research-backed principles, you create articles that respect
your readers' time and attention.

**Remember the core principles:**

- Large, legible text (18px+)
- Comfortable line width (50-75 chars)
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Structural helpers for long content
- High contrast, clean design
